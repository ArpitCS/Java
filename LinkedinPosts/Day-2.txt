ðŸš€ Exciting Update on My #100DaysOfCode Journey! ðŸš€

Over the past few days, I've delved deep into the world of Arrays and ArrayLists by tackling a series of challenges on LeetCode. Here's a quick recap of the problems I worked on:

1. **Build Array from Permutation**
2. **Concatenation of Array**
3. **Running Sum of 1D Array**
4. **Richest Customer Wealth**
5. **Shuffle the Array**
6. **Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies**
7. **Number of Good Pairs**
8. **How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number**
9. **Create Target Array in the Given Order**
10. **Check if the Sentence Is Pangram**
11. **Count Items Matching a Rule**
12. **Find the Highest Altitude**
13. **Flipping an Image**
14. **Cells with Odd Values in a Matrix**
15. **Matrix Diagonal Sum**
16. **Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits**
17. **Transpose Matrix**
18. **Add to Array-Form of Integer**

Each problem not only challenged my understanding of data structures but also enhanced my problem-solving skills. From building arrays to manipulating data, I've gained invaluable insights along the way.

ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:
- Mastery of arrays is crucial for efficient coding.
- Practical application through problem-solving solidifies concepts.
- Persistence pays offâ€”donâ€™t shy away from challenging problems!

Looking forward to the next phase of my coding journey! If you're also on the #100DaysOfCode challenge, let's connect and share our experiences! ðŸ’ªðŸ’»
