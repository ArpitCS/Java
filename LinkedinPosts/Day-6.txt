🚀 Day 5 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode! Today, I put my understanding of the Selection Sort algorithm to the test by solving some basic questions. 🛠️

Here’s what I accomplished:

Selection Sort Practice:
- Reviewed and solidified my implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm in Java.
- Practiced by solving some straightforward problems that required the application of the algorithm.

LeetCode Problems:
- #88: Merge Sorted Array – Merged two sorted arrays into one, reinforcing my sorting skills!
- #169: Majority Element – Identified the element that appears more than half the time in an array, utilizing my sorting knowledge to help with the solution.
