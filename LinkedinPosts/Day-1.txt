🚀 Excited to kick off Day 1 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode! Today, I dove into data structures with Java, focusing on Arrays and ArrayLists. 🛠️

Here’s what I covered:
- Understanding Arrays and ArrayLists in Java
- Key methods for manipulation
- Exploring Wrapper Classes

For implementing these basics and related methods:
1. Finding the minimum and maximum elements in an array
2. Reversing an array
3. Swapping elements within an array

It feels great to start this journey, and I'm eager to build my skills further. 💪💻 If you're also coding or learning something new, feel free to share your experiences or tips! Let's grow together! 🌟
