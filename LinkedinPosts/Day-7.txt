🚀 Day 7 of #100DaysOfCode! Today was all about solving more algorithmic challenges and diving deeper into sorting techniques. 🛠️

Here's what I tackled:

Algorithm Practice:
- Solidified my understanding of array manipulation by working on these LeetCode problems:
  - #389: Find the Difference – Found the extra character in two strings using clever string manipulation.
  - #977: Squares of a Sorted Array – Applied my sorting skills to sort the squares of numbers in a sorted array.

💡 These problems helped reinforce my grasp of arrays and sorting, and I’m excited to keep pushing forward in this challenge!

Let’s keep coding and growing together! 💻✨
